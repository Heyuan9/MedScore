Why does the animation fail in (apparently) random and uncontrollable ways?","response":"Animators are not sitting there animating each and every point on the 3D model. There are just too many of these points. So instead they set up the rules for how each point will move and then let the computer deal with all the details. One common technique is to set up a skeleton of the character and then map each point on the model to a part of the skeleton. So when you move the skeleton the computer can calculate the position of every point on the model. For cloth there is a different algorithm doing fancy cloth simulation to figure out how the cloth will hang on the model. For hair you actually have particle simulation which calculates the path that particles would take if they were shooting out from the top of the head and then drawing this path as a strand of hair.\n\nThe bloopers you see here are when the computer is not giving the animator what he wants. It can be that a certain skeleton position the calculations break down and you get weird results. Or the cloth simulation does not handle a certain edge case. All sorts of things which look weird.","id":3,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}

{"language":4,"question_type":1,"question":"Why are alcohol bottles not required to have nutritional labels? (like calories, carbohydrates, sodium, etc...) ","question_english":"Why are alcohol bottles not required to have nutritional labels? (like calories, carbohydrates, sodium, etc...) ","response":"The main reason, as others have pointed out, is because alcohol is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, but rather by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) and, to a lesser extent, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). FDA has very specific guidelines as to what information food producers must put on the labels of their products. These guidelines do not cover alcohol, as the FDA has no regulatory power in that area.\n\nThere are other labeling laws, which alcohol producers must follow, such as listing the percent of pure alcohol in the beverage by volume. These regulations are laid out and enforced by TTB.\n\nThis is currently a matter of some debate, as there are players in the beer industry that strongly support requiring nutrition info labeling requirements on alcohol similar to food and non-alcoholic beverages. Why? Because they want to dispel the notion that hard liquor and wine are \"healthy\" alternatives to beer. Although hard liquor has no carbohydrates, it is very high in calories. When mixed with juice or soda, it can wind up being significantly higher in calories than the average beer. However, the beer industry can't unilaterally start doing this on their own, because there are actually prohibitions on what they are allowed to print on their label in terms of nutrition facts, since alcoholic beverages are considered nutritionally deficient.","id":6,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}

What they can do is take averages and get pretty close to an accurate answer.\n\nBars\/restaurants typically pay for TV based on their seating capacity or fire occupancy rating. By surveying different types of establishments across the country they can get a pretty accurate estimation of how full they are. For the Super Bowl I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s in the 90% range.\n\nSame thing for homes - Nielsen is a company that\u2019s been around for over 100 years and they specialize on data collection for consumer marketing.

","response":"Because by tradition the army doesn't belong to the King, it belongs to the nobility.\n\nThe King is responsible for maintaining the Navy, and later the Air Force (at least on paper) hence the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.\n\nBut historically the army was made up of various units maintained by the Lords. The Lord would be responsible for equipping and training his own forces and would also serve as commander of that force which is where the idea of Officers came from.\n\nArmies would be put together on demand at the request of the King and combined together to form a larger force.\n\nThe idea of a permanent standing army didn't come in being until 1660.\n\nAnother point is the current British Army is actually descended from the New Model Army in the British Civil War, since they fought for the parliamentarians against the crown it wasn't considered appropriate to call the army 'Royal'. However numerous units like Royal Signal Corps have Royal in their name because they were founded later.\n\nThe British Parliament actually has to pass a law every year to maintain a standing army. If they don't technically the British Army ceases to exist.

Then they just had...\"Winter\"...which was a more vague period that lasted until they were ready for March again.\n\nIn time they added two additional months, January and February, although there were still different ways of counting how many days were in each month, so they continued to have shorter \"Winter\" periods before the year started over in March.\n\nThe Julian calendar, established by Julius Caesar in 45 BC, firmly established how many days were in each month and moved the start of the year from March to January 1. Most of the months kept their original names, which is why SEPTember and OCTober are now months nine and ten when they sound like they should be seven and eight (because they used to be). Some time after Caesar, the months Quintillus and Sextillus (once months five and six, now seven and eight) were renamed July and August.\n\nThe months may once have been aligned with the equinoxes and solstices, but since the length of the year was so strangely variable for such a long time, those fixed points in the earth's orbit drifted over the calendar toward where they are now.

","question_english":"why are there no ancient monumental structures in present day US? \n\nMexico and Central America have plenty of ancient, monumental structures (e.g., Chichen Itza). But the continental US and Canada do not. Why? ","response":"A few do exist. Cahokia (just outside of St Louis) is a World Heritage Site and the largest extant ancient ruins in North America. Aztlan (in Wisconsin) was built by the same culture and is a very similar site, just on a smaller scale. Great Serpent Mound, in Ohio, is a massive burial site on a horizontal scale that rivals Giza, though the fact that it's less vertical and not in a desert obscures a lot of its grandure (trees do that). Speaking of desert, various cliff dwellings in the southwest (most notably Mesa Verde in Colorado) are astonishing in their scope and complexity.\n\nPart of the problem is just geology. The major civilizations of ancient North America were heavily clustered in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. These are great places for a stable agricultural society, but much less great for hard stone building materials like what you need to build Chichen Itza. Most of the places with good access to stone building materials were also comparatively bad for agriculture. The Nile Delta is a relatively unique phenomenon with respect to geology, geography, local biota, and proximity to early homo sapiens evolution. The combination of an arid climate (which helps preserve everything, since rain and humidity are awful for stuff), easily accessible bedrock veins, and abundant access to incredibly fertile soil and reliable water is not something that happens in many places around the world. The Colorado River delta in present-day North-Western Mexico is the closest thing that I can think of anywhere else in the world, and it's not as good as the Nile in any of these respects (and also was first inhabited about a million years after the Nile was).\n\nThe Columbia River gorge strikes me as one counter-example to this, though I'm not aware of any large hierarchical societies (a la the Mississippians, Aztec, Maya, or Inca) in that area despite its dense population and fertility.\n\nSo yeah\u2026 Tldr, the areas where civilizations flourished in North America didn't have extensive stone building materials, so they built earthworks instead. These were spectacular, but they also erode much faster and are in locations where trees happily overgrow everything. You should visit Cahokia though, it's really very impressive. A lot like what Chichen Itza would look like if they had to build it out of dirt rather than stone (I've spent time at both sites).","id":26,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}

","question_english":"We've had a helium shortage for a while, what happens when it becomes more scarce, plus what happens when we run out?\n\nDo the fields of medicine, manufacturing, etc. get adversely affected? ","response":"We will have helium so long as we have natural gas. The shortage is because from the 1925, the US started storing helium in a reserve, thinking airships were going to be a big thing. That didn't pan out, but then rockets became a thing, and they use helium to back fill fuel tanks, so the reserve grew in anticipation of rockets being a big thing. Finally, by 1995, everyone realised that helium wasn't actually that vital, and the reserve was very expensive, so they started selling it off very cheaply. This undercut everyone else, and nobody really bothered with helium extraction anymore.\n\nNow that reserve is running low, so prices are rising again. That's the shortage. It's more of a return from artificially low prices.\n\nAs helium prices rise, it's becoming economical to separate it from natural gas again.\n\nWhat is helium used for? Well it's very light, inert, and basically doesn't freeze. It doesn't even become a liquid until single digit kelvin temperatures. So cryogenics that want to operate in those temperatures, rockets, airships... We'll never run out completely, and there are alternatives. With cryogenics, better magnets are superconducting at higher temperatures which don't need liquid helium, so MRI machines etc will stop needing it. Total loss systems are being replaced by systems that recycle their helium.\n\nHelium party balloons should never have been a thing though.

Is this amount determined by physics, trial and error or ?","response":"So, bolts are usually made from metal, generally steel. Steel is stretchy and elastic, and that's a good thing because when the steel is slightly pulled out of shape, it wants to go back into shape like a stretched rubber band. And just like a rubber band, that stretchy force can be used to hold things in place.\n\nBut steel gets deformed if you stretch it too far. You can bend a paper clip a little and it'll snap back, but bend it much further and it holds the new shape. This is bad.\n\nWe know a lot about steel. We know exactly how stretchy it is, at exactly what point that elastic stretchiness turns into permanent bending. We know how much friction it will have against another piece of steel. There are many types of steel and we have this information on all of them.\n\nGiven that information, there are equations where you plug in a bunch of numbers (the carbon content, thickness, diameter, thread size, etc etc etc of the parts used) and it will tell you the ideal amount of torque.\n\nFor critical applications this will then be tested destructively (tighten until the steel bends - note that as too much) and non-destructively (tighten the prescribed amount, stress-test the joint, loosen and re-tighten and stress-test again).","id":30,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}

","question_english":"Why is the game development industry laying off so many people? \n\nIt feels like every day I see a post about some big game development studio laying off a large chunk of their workforce. What are the causes of this? ","response":"There\u2019s two main reasons that are impacting not just the game dev industry but others as well.\n\nThe first reason is that there\u2019s been a lot of corporate acquisitions lately like Microsoft buying Activision-Blizzard (AB). When that happens you get a lot of redundant positions that the parents company can absorb, which means there\u2019s going to be layoffs in the future.\n\nAs an example, say there\u2019s a department at AB in charge of hiring \/ Talent acquisition. Microsoft already has a department that does that, so most of those people (minus a few token employees who know the AB company culture) will be let go.\n\nThe second reason is tied around interest rates. That is an ELI5 in itself, but basically for most of the last decade it was super cheap to get money and use that for projects. Now, it\u2019s significantly more expensive to get a loan for money, so companies are less willing to spend money and\/or need to cut back because they were supported by cheap money.\n\nSo as an example, say you\u2019re a small game dev in 2013. You can probably get a loan from a Venture Capital (VC) fund for almost zero interest, and there\u2019s tons of VCs available to offer you money. Because of that, it\u2019s easy to get money to fund your game studio. Fast forward to 2023, and now there are fewer VCs and they charge more interest for their loans.

It's just recommended to wait a little while (usually 30-60 minutes) after meals, before you brush your teeth.\n\nSome sources say to do this mainly after consuming acidic foods. The reason being that acid softens your tooth enamel, and so brushing your teeth in this weakened state can damage them. It also helps to rinse your mouth with water after eating anything acidic, to get rid of the acids faster.\n\nOther sources say all foods lower the pH inside your mouth (making it more acidic), and so to wait after consuming any food or drink. The reasoning behind this seems to be that your mouth bacteria consume sugars and starches and turn them into acid. This is a little confusing, since removing these bacteria (and the food they munch on and the plaque they build up), and stopping them from producing acid is the main reason for brushing your teeth the first place. So I'm not sure whether to believe this as I can't find an unequivocal expert source on this. I guess it depends on how quickly bacteria turn food into acid. If it's fast, then it makes sense that you'd have to wait a while for your saliva pH to return to normal. If it's slow, then it makes more sense to get in there quickly and remove the bacteria and remaining food particles from your teeth by brushing them, before the bacteria can do their tooth-decaying business.\n\nIn any case, if you can wait a while after eating breakfast, it's totally fine to brush after, rather than before. Brushing before is fine too as far as dental hygiene is concerned, but might make your breakfast taste bad if you eat it soon after. So either way, you want to leave some time between brushing and eating (or vice versa).\n\nAs for coffee, it is only mildly acidic and, if you drink it black, contains little or no starch or sugar. So I don't see a strong reason to wait after (only) drinking coffee, before brushing your teeth. Having coffee with breakfast shouldn't make a difference one way or another.","id":39,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}

You're also more likely to have people who aren't travelling need to get onto the platform for long-distance systems, such as family members helping people to get to the train and see them off.

Second, it irritates the lining of your blood vessels, causing them to swell and become less flexible, which makes them narrower and easier to clog.

Trail is the measurement of where the steering axis in relation to the contact of the wheel on the ground. Here's a picture for illustration. This is also called the caster effect.

{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"Why do different animals have different life spans?","question_english":"Why do different animals have different life spans?","response":"Life span is a pretty complicated topic, but we can understand it by using what is known as life history theory.  This is basically the idea that the timing of life events such as how long an animal grows, when and how many times it reproduces, and when it dies are developed through the process of natural selection.  As such, total lifespan for a given species has evolved in a manner similar to any other adaptation, and is related to what will allow that animal to survive, and more importantly, to reproduce in a given environment.\n\nSo what are some factors that influence life history and life span?\n\nLife history and average age at death are often linked to body size, and with some exceptions (like bats) larger body size is associated with a longer life span.  For example, mice live a year or maybe two and have what we call a \u201cfast\u201d life history, while a large whale or elephant will live for decades with a \u201cslow\u201d life history.  But why do some animals have a fast life and some a slow life?\n\nPart of this can be explained by looking at extrinsic mortality and how animals have to partition their energetic resources.  An animal can put its energy into either growth, bodily maintenance or reproduction. However energy input is ultimately limited by the environment, so an animal cannot invest into all three infinitely and must therefore partition how much effort it will place into each of these categories. Basically, do you grow a lot, get big, and reproduce only a few offspring? Or do you grow quickly, stay small and reproduce a lot of kids?\n\nOne thing that helps decide this is that all animals face extrinsic mortality - basically the likelihood you\u2019ll be taken out by another animal (e.g. predation) or by the environment (e.g., changing seasons, flooding, etc.). If you are faced with high extrinsic mortality, this favors getting in the game reproductively early in life.  In these species you in turn see less investment in growth and bodily maintenance.  They therefore tend to be small, live a short period of time and produce a lot of kids they don\u2019t put a ton of investment into.  Think mice, mayflies and the like.  In contrast, animals with lower extrinsic mortality tend to take time to grow larger (which also further reduces extrinsic mortality), and take a longer time reproducing a smaller number of individuals whom they put a lot of investment into getting to survive their growth into adulthood (think primates, whales and elephants).  \n\nAs long-lived, smart primates we often think of our \u201cslow\u201d life history as \u201cbetter\u201d than a mouse\u2019s short life.  It\u2019s important to recognize that these are simply different, but equally effective, strategies for getting your genes into the next generation.  While a slow life history allows for the development of things like our big brain and tapping on a phone, our mouse friends ultimately have pretty effective strategy in terms of natural selection as well. I\u2019ve really only scratched the surface here, and there are a ton of other factors to look at when it comes to lifespan (e.g., BMR, phylogenetic effects, etc.), but if you are interested there is a lot out there on life history theory.","id":76,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}

Is there a way to prevent this?","response":"There is an enzyme in the onion that causes the crying.\n\nFun fact it was recently found that this enzyme has no effect on the onions flavor, so yes with genetic modification we could in fact create tear free onions!","id":80,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"Why is a runner's heart rate lower than that of a non-runner?","question_english":"Why is a runner's heart rate lower than that of a non-runner?","response":"Because their cardiovascular systems are strong. They've worked out their heart muscles to the point where they can get all the blood circulation they need with fewer beats. The heart only beats as fast as it needs to.","id":81,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"Can weather be controlled or man made? If so, to what extent and how?","question_english":"Can weather be controlled or man made? If so, to what extent and how?","response":"Short answer: yes to a very limited extent\n\nLonger answer: not in any realistic, safe, or controllable way.\n\nWeather is super complicated and often pretty hard to predict. Imagine if you had a big bowl of water and you kept sloshing it around, meteorology is guessing\/analyzing where individual waves will form.\n\nYou can effect the weather by large releases of heat or particulates, but both have enormous ecological impacts and are expensive. Also if you mess with the weather in one place you tend to fuck over somewhere else (a la butterfly effect).\n\nSo generally its not safe, cheap, or smart, but we could technically do it minorly.","id":82,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}

{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"How do animals sense an upcoming earthquake?","question_english":"How do animals sense an upcoming earthquake?","response":"generally speaking, earthquakes propagate through p (pressure) waves and s (transverse) waves. think side to side and up and down. the p waves come first, and often are below your perception threshold (you just don't notice them). the S waves, which you are much more likely to notice, come after as they travel more slowly. these are what you are thinking of when you think of an earthquake.\n\nanimals like dogs are much more in tune to the preceding p waves, and noticed them before you do. that is why it appears they predict them just beforehand. they are not, they are just sensing them before you.","id":84,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"What is the function of sleep?","question_english":"What is the function of sleep?","response":"Your brain uses it as time to organize, commit short-term memory to long-term memory, and flush out toxins and waste that build up during the day.\n\nThat organization process is believed to be what dreaming is. Applying the knowledge it has in different ways and different situations, and reinforcing things it already learned.\n\nThe toxin flushing process requires neurons to retract and blood vessels to dilate to make more room for those toxins to be flushed out.","id":85,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}

They're insanely tricky to produce and purify. ","id":86,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"In an iPhone, where do deleted files and photos go after being deleting from 'recently deleted'?","question_english":"In an iPhone, where do deleted files and photos go after being deleting from 'recently deleted'?","response":"This is the same for all electronics. They aren't really deleted, they're just not indexed anymore and the device will eventually overwrite that sector of storage.\n\nEspecially with solid state drives, where the data is located physically doesn't really matter to your device. The drive itself pays attention to the physical location, but the device only cares about the address. Basically, the device goes \"Give me the data for the bit kept at location #123\" and the device knows that this virtual location is the transistor in row 501, column 729.\n\nWhen you delete data, what you're really doing is just deleting that entry in the device's address book. It forgets what is kept at location #123 and stops asking about it. The physical transistors aren't changed, yet, they just sit there with whatever bits were saved before. Eventually, your device will need to save new information, and it'll look in the address book to see which locations aren't being used. It'll see that location #123 is unused, and write the new data to that location. This overwrites the old data, which is the physical deletion of that data.","id":87,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"What keeps the oceans from flooding the earth?","question_english":"What keeps the oceans from flooding the earth?","response":"Gravity. The gravity of the Earth pulls the oceans (and all liquids) to the lowest point they can go. That's why rivers flow downhill from mountains into the ocean.\n\nThe same force that keeps water inside your glass keeps the water of the oceans in the ocean.","id":88,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"Why is it harder to fall asleep in noisy environments?","question_english":"Why is it harder to fall asleep in noisy environments?","response":"Humans (and therefore our brains) evolved in a wild environment. Certain noises (or noises of certain pitches or volumes) are associated with various dangers, loud noises are usually signs of threats for example (people shout when scared or hurt), and the sound of rustling leaves nearby could be the sound of a moving predator. Even though most of those threats are irrelevant to you in your daily life these processes are ingrained in the way your brain develops. When you hear these threat noises, your brain reacts, it becomes alert and readies you to fight or run. This alertness prevents sleep because you are vulnerable when asleep.","id":89,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"Why do we still use gigantic TV studio cameras when the same technology is now cell phone sized?","question_english":"Why do we still use gigantic TV studio cameras when the same technology is now cell phone sized?","response":"A larger lens gathers more light. Period. A larger lens weighs more which requires a larger frame to carry it. A larger frame allows for a larger sensor. A larger sensor generates more data which makes it easier to perform noise reduction. In short, that much larger camera is also MUCH more capable than your cell phone.","id":90,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"Is pain a completely accurate indicator of the condition of physical injuries?","question_english":"Is pain a completely accurate indicator of the condition of physical injuries?","response":"When I snapped my arm in half it didn't hurt at all. Nerve damage can lead to no pain, and is pretty serious. Disease such as leprosy can lead to lack of pain, leading to unnoticed injuries and infections.","id":91,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"Why can't we exterminate fleas entirely? ","question_english":"Why can't we exterminate fleas entirely? ","response":"They continue to exist on wild animals, such as deer and foxes, as well as in grass, carpet, etc. They are a source of food for many insectivores as well. There are also many many species of flea. It would be too massive of an undertaking to attempt to kill all of them without harming the animals that prey on them","id":92,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"What exactly is going on with my computer when it crashes?","question_english":"What exactly is going on with my computer when it crashes?","response":"Most of these answers are really bad. The most common causes of computer crashes are not infinite loops, memory overflows, or corrupted files. In fact all of those answers would only in rare cases cause the entire system to crash.\n\nThe most common cause of computer crashes are faulty hardware or faulty system drivers. Video card drivers are a very common cause of computer crashes. Corrupted memory also a common cause of crashes. Out of date drivers or system libraries can also cause crashing.\n\nBasically a crash is when your system tries to do something very low level like read memory, or display something to the screen and the result is something the computer cannot understand. Since there is no way back, and continuing could do unexpected and irreversible things the system just stops and forces you to restart to get it back into a normal state.","id":93,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}

Meaning you won't hit critical levels of disrepair, but they will at some point.","id":94,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
{"language":4,"question_type":0,"question":"How do sheep turn grass and water into milk, wool and more sheep?","question_english":"How do sheep turn grass and water into milk, wool and more sheep?","response":"Sheep like cows have an incredible bioreactor in them that turns the ingredients of grass into proteins through the use of their multi-chambered stomachs. They send all their time eating and food stays in their multiple stomachs where it's ground up, churned, mixed with acid, broken down by bacteria, the regurgitated as cud, them chewed up again to be further broken down by bacteria to transform it into the ingredients necessary to make more cow. We have significantly less complicated stomachs so we require a varied diet, but we don't have to spend all day eating. ","id":95,"model":"human","prompt_source":"human"}
