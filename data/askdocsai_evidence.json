Other things that may cause avascular necrosis include steroid use, excessive alcohol intake/abuse, chemotherapy, sickle cell disease, and certain hematological conditions. I highly recommend that you see an orthopedic surgeon who works with hips. Depending on how your CT scan looks, your doctor may order and MRI to get a better look of your hips. I see that you claimed not to have sickle cell disease or have used steroids excessively. When you speak to an orthopedic surgeon, they may ask you about your alcohol use. It is very important to be honest since excessive alcohol consumption is linked to AVN. It is also worrisome that you are having pain in your knees, and it should be examined by your doctor. Please be honest about everything with your doctor. They are not there to judge you. Rather, they are there to help you and recommend treatments. As a hematologist/oncologist, I would recommend talking to your doctor about a hematology workup to exclude certain diseases that may cause avascular necrosis. With osteonecrosis, we want to prevent the femoral head from collapsing. Once it has reached the collapse stage, treatment typically includes total hip replacements. Since your CT scan has showed that you are still in the pre collapse stage, your surgeon may recommend a surgery called a core decompression with or without bone grafting. I received this surgery in one of my hips, but your case may be totally different than mine. This is much less invasive than a total hip replacement, and it will help you with the pain. It may help delay the need for a total hip replacement, as you are a little too young for that at 29 years old. I am sorry to hear that you are going through this, and I understand what it feels like from a patient's perspective since I suffer from avascular necrosis. Speaking from personal experience, AVN is quite painful and you should have this investigated as soon as possible. Ask your PCP/GP for a referral to see an orthopedic surgeon ASAP.

If you had a negative throat culture, then it is extraordinarily likely that you didn't have strep throat. The overuse of antibiotics is a huge problem for society in general, and for individuals. Some patients, apparently like yourself, are given unnecessary antibiotics over and over again, and are at high risk for the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms, as well as other issues that can develop, such as changes in the gut microbiome that can lead to diarrhea, and other serious infections like pseudomembranous colitis.

This has contributed to a widespread problem with opioid use disorder. We are all trying to treat our patients as well as we can, and to minimize the use of opioids, as the adverse effects, including addiction, can be severe. Some emergency departments (usually in areas with a high prevalence of opioid use disorder) have established policies like this. Their belief is (in my opinion) that the policy is a tool that physicians can use to help explain why patients aren't getting opioids for common problems like a sprained ankle or low back pain, where the risk far outweighs the benefit.

Remember that like the COVID vaccine, the point is to reduce the number of people who get so sick that they need hospitalization. Even if you needed to go to the ER, it could be that if you hadn't been vaccinated, you would have needed to go to the ICU, or you would've been sick for 2 weeks, not just 5 days. Another way that the flu vaccine isn't perfect is that it's always based on our best estimate of which strains of influenza will be prevalent that season. We can't 100% predict, so sometimes there isn't a perfect match there.

That said, if your last pap was completely normal then it is unlikely that a carcinoma will have developed. Unlikely, but not impossible. The length of time between cervical screening tests is chosen because in the vast majority of cases simple cellular atypia will not turn malignant over this time. As good as the screens are they depend on human skills to sample the correct area of the cervix. Sometimes the abnormal area gets missed. The tests also don't give a warning in time if someone develops a particularly aggressive, fast growing cancer that could spring up between smears.
