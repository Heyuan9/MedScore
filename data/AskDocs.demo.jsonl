Since you've had your primary tetanus shots as a child, you don't need immunoglobulin (IGG) shots, and they were actually unnecessary during your last visit. \n\nConsidering your tetanus vaccine expired in 2020 and you've got a dirty wound from the Spartan race, your doctor recommends getting a tetanus booster vaccine as soon as possible. They also mentioned that you were due for a booster anyway since it's been more than 3 years since your last vaccine.\n\nYour doctor is a bit puzzled as to why you were given IGG shots instead of a vaccine during your last visit, but that's not a concern for now. They just want to make sure you get the booster vaccine to be on the safe side. It's best to schedule an appointment for the booster vaccine as soon as possible to avoid any potential risks."}

The doctor noted that while these substances may have positive effects on muscle and bone health, they also carry significant risks and potential side effects.\n\nThe doctor mentioned that the anabolic cycle your partner is on is quite intense and requires careful monitoring for potential issues such as infertility, mood swings, and problems related to weight gain, including snoring and possible sleep apnea. They also emphasized the importance of considering the long-term effects of using these substances, particularly when they are stopped.\n\nThe doctor's primary concern is that your partner's underlying condition, Addison's disease, may not significantly complicate things if well-treated, but it could become an issue when the anabolic cycle is stopped. They strongly advise that your partner consult with a medical professional, ideally their endocrinologist, to discuss the potential risks and consequences of using these substances, especially given their pre-existing condition.\n\nIt's essential to have an open and honest conversation with a healthcare professional to ensure your partner's safety and well-being. I would encourage you to support your partner in seeking medical advice, and I'm happy to facilitate a discussion with their doctor if needed."}

My sociology professor has done some research that notes a high level of patient re-admission and the endless \"revolving door syndrome\" in some local hospitals being attributed to a language barrier between the physician and the patient. So, an english-speaking physician may not be fully understood by a Spanish-speaking patient, leading to issues with the patient following the instructions of the physician. (Or vise-versa, with the patient's medical issues being misheard or misunderstood.) ____ As a student with a passion for foreign language, and active local tutor, I would love to help build some sort of a program (both better and cheaper than the Rosetta Stone garbage) aimed to help physicians. I know you're incredibly busy people, so I want your help in designing a course that fits your needs the best. This brings me to two questions. 1. What language would you benefit the most from learning? 2. What medium would you prefer the most? * Something you can listen to on the way to work, or during lunch? * A program you can watch to help visualize the language? * A workbook you can follow along with? * Something else? 3. What information, in terms of vocabulary, would be the most important to include?

Other important factors include education, home support, medication noncompliance, and lack of primary care. \n\nIn terms of a language course, your doctor thinks that Duolingo is a good option. However, they noted that it's challenging for doctors to find the time to learn multiple languages, as there are many languages spoken by patients in their area, including Spanish, Hmong, Chinese, and Polish.

{"id": "4evktk_20241101", "question": "RECENT EMERGENCY APPENDECTOMY, SORE EVERYWHERE, WEAKNESS I went into the ER on Tuesday night with stomach pains. Wednesday mid-day I had an appendectomy larascopically. I have extreme anxiety and benzo tolerance and I *literally* did not sleep from 2 PM Tuesday (when I wake up--I have day night reversal) until I left the hospital Thursday at 10 AM. After my surgery, they wouldn't give me my normal medicines and I went into benzodiazepine withdrawal. The nurses did not speak English well and transcribed my medication schedule wrong, which the doctor then made my schedule and they wouldnt give me anything not on the schedule. I was eventually able to reach my psychiatrist before I left who called the on-call nurse who then called the surgeon who gave me my normal medicine, but it didnt do much since I only got part of what I normally take and still didnt sleep. As soon as I got home, I was able to relax and sleep. The thing is that I think they had me leave so soon because they were concerned about me not sleeping. It all happened very fast. No one really checked whether I could walk or not, and I didnt get up until after the doctor had seen me when I got into the wheelchair to move. It was very very hard. My dad was called in after I was coming out from under anesthesia because I was having a really hard time coming out. Apparently I was flailing my arms and legs, the anesthesiologist and surgeon stood back, and 4 nurses were trying to hold me down so I didnt fall out of the bed and so my wires didnt come off. They brought my dad back to calm me down. I don't remember any of this. I apparently accidnetally hit one nurse in the face and she got a bloody nose. My dad thinks that this flailing is why I am so sore. My stomach muscles were very sore when I was in the bed at the hospital. But since I left (yesterday at 10 am), it's been my legs and arms that feel so incredibly sore. It feels like I did a thousand push-ups and squats. I called the after-hours surgeon and he said that being sore would be normal from muscle twitching that happens under anesthesia. However, he was concerned that I had so much trouble getting out of bed. In fact, up until recently I've been peeing into a urinal I brought home with me. Once I get up, it's not as bad. It's going from lying to sitting to standing or going from lying one side to another that's so hard. I think because I can't use my stomach muscles, every time I get up I am putting my full weight on my arms to push myself up to sit. And then when I get out of bed it's like I am doing a reverse squat with my leg muscles. The problem is that these muscles feel wasted. They are already so sore and weak that at first it was almost impossible to get up out of bed once I got home. Just scooting up in bed and trying to sit up more would take me like 20 minutes of holding onto the sheets for leverage and trying to pull myself up. The doctor said I should be sore but not weak. He told me to take ibuprofen and said if I feel better that's good, but if I still have so much trouble getting up I need to go to the emergency room. I woke up my parents to tell them this, and they are furious with me and will refuse to take me to the ER if I need to go. They think I am a hypochondriac. They wouldn't take me to the ER Tuesday night becaus they thought my stomach pain was just gas and I had to take an ambulance by myself. I have agoraphobia so this was very hard to do. The last thing I want is to go to the hospital again. Things DO seem somewhat better in terms of being able to get out of bed. It is extremely painful and difficult. But I don't know how bad is too bad. I mean I can live with the pain. But I'm concerned if it means something worse is wrong. I took the ibuprofen about an hour ago. I haven't felt any difference from taking it. Before that I was taking Tylenol which didn't help. They gave me Norco, but I only took one because I am on the benzos already and when I took it my 02 saturation dropped quite a bit. If the soreness and ability to get up are getting a little better bit by bit, is that enough? Also I am normally extremely sedentary.

Initial assessment shows Covid pneumonia and acute myocardial infarction. Relevant history: Type 1 DM, CKD2, NPDR, HTN, PVD s/p bypass RLE, hyperlipidemia, obesity class 2. Patient had full vaccinations. Patient was transferred to a level one trauma center where they attempted a PCI and the physician could not pass the balloon, despite a 50% blockage. Patient was brought up to the ICU and thrombolytics was initiated. An intra-aortic balloon pump was put in and due to the critical illness, physician opted to intubate and placed patient in a medically induced coma. On hospital day two, an echo was done, and it came back fine. Unfortunately, further information came in on hospital day 4 patient is in acute heart failure and COPD despite not having any history prior to admit. Not a smoker. Attempts at weaning the patient off the ventilator fail as pulse ox drops to dangerous levels. Patient diagnosed with Acute CHF and COPD. My understanding according to the AMA, is that someone presenting with Covid and a myocardial infarction has a 56 or so percent of mortality. The patient also went without treatment for COVID-19 due to physician, not feeling comfortable with paxlovid due to interactions with insulin and clopidogrel. Patient did not seek treatment from another physician, which I believe was a mistake. Perhaps an infusion of a more suitable medication could have been arranged. Patient also went without their clopidogrel for 10 days due to coordination of care issues. Could this have played a part in precipitating the MI? Questions: With the new diagnoses of CHF, COPD, and presumptive diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, with hypoxia secondary to the chemically induced coma, what are the chances of survival?

Unfortunately, the patient had many underlying risk factors that made them more susceptible to severe illness from any infection, not just COVID-19.\n\nRegarding the patient going without clopidogrel for 10 days, the doctor agrees that this may have contributed to the MI, although it's impossible to determine the exact extent of its impact.\n\nAs for the new diagnoses of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute respiratory failure, the doctor did not provide a specific prognosis. However, they did mention that the patient's underlying health conditions and the severity of their illness have made their situation more challenging.\n\nThe doctor also believes that initiating COVID-19 treatment at the time of presentation may not have significantly altered the course of the patient's illness.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions or concerns."}

Unfortunately, there aren't any specific supplements, pills, diets, or exercises that can significantly impact your height. \n\nYou mentioned that you're doing stretching exercises twice a day, but as your doctor noted, it's unlikely to make a noticeable difference in your height. \n\nIf you're curious about your expected adult height, your doctor suggested looking up a growth curve chart. This chart can help you estimate your potential adult height based on your current age and height. To do this, you can plot your age and height on the chart, then draw a line parallel to the other curved lines on the chart.

{"id": "xmdhyt_20241101", "question": "Please help. Blood pressures been high for a week. I dont know what to do I tried posting about this last week, but never got an answer. Its still bugging me. Background: 25M, 59, 220lbs. Very active (power lifter no PEDs). Occasional drinker, maybe once every couple weeks. Bad, bad, bad caffeine and nicotine problems (vape & Zyn) which I know automatically sets off alarm bells. I have stopped vaping since Sunday though, and really tapered off Zyn. Flashback to last Wednesday night. I felt perfectly fine. Got up to take my supplements before bed (vitamin D, zinc, vitamin C). Accidentally took magnesium because it looked like the zinc bottle and I didnt have my contacts in. I didnt think anything of it since magnesium isnt supposed to be bad for you, and it was just one tablet. About half an hour later, I started becoming really aware of my heartbeat. It felt like it was a bit fluttery, and I was scared to sleep. Eventually I did sleep, but the feeling continued into Thursday before disappearing by Friday. Yet, by Saturday my chest started feeling tight, and my heart felt it was really going; however, my heart rate was in the normal range per the tracker I have. I tried to chalk it up to anxiety, but was freaked out by Monday night that I had my dad (a nurse) take my blood pressure. He had it at 160/80. Tuesday I went to my doctor. She had my blood pressure at 137/84, so not as bad. She told me she thought I had GERD and anxiety, and told me an EKG was unnecessary. Yet here we are, three days later, and Im still intensely aware of my heartbeat. My dad just took my blood pressure again, and it was 150/90. I feel like my normal self, aside from a bit of tightness on the right side of my chest and that Im still aware of my heartbeat (well, add anxiety to the mix, too). Im freaking out that theres something really wrong with me, but I dont want to go to the ER. I think Im going to go to urgent care tomorrow. I guess I just want someone to tell me Im not dying lol.", "doctor_response": "You're likely not dying, anxiety and pain will both increase your heart rate and blood pressure. I'd recommend doing a 5-day BP trend to see where you fall out. Try taking your pressure during downtime/relax time, 10 minutes after sitting in a chair, uncrossed legs, no caffeine or nicotine prior to the reading. If your BP averages out to SBP > 140 over the 5 days then see your doctor for further follow-up.", "response": "I spoke to your doctor and they wanted to reassure you that, based on the information you provided, it's unlikely that you're in immediate danger. They believe that your anxiety and any discomfort you're experiencing may be contributing to your increased heart rate and blood pressure. \n\nTo get a better understanding of your blood pressure, your doctor recommends taking your blood pressure at home over the next 5 days to track any patterns. It's essential to take these readings during relaxed periods, such as when you're sitting calmly in a chair with your legs uncrossed. Also, please avoid consuming caffeine or nicotine before taking your blood pressure. \n\nAfter 5 days, if your average systolic blood pressure (the top number) is above 140, your doctor would like you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss further. This will help them determine the best course of action to address your concerns."}
{"id": "yd8eie_20241101", "question": "High BMI = No visibility in ultrasound? I (33F) started my period for the first time in 4 years (hormonal IUD) and so went and had an ultrasound. Did both over-the-belly and internal ultrasound, but was told in my patient portal a couple days later that - due to my high BMI (445lbs) - there was no visibility. They suggested I get an MRI instead. I've done some research but can't find anything conclusive about whether this is normal? And the tech didn't say anything during the ultrasound, so it felt like something out of left field. Help? (As an aside, I am currently working on my weight! My primary focus for this post is the ultrasound.)", "doctor_response": "I'm not accustomed to intravaginal ultrasound, but with surface ultrasound the sound waves really only image 3-4 inches under the skin. So if there are 3 inches of fat under the skin, then all you'll see is fat. I'm assuming it's the same with intravaginal ultrasound, except the fat is all around the organs instead.", "response": "I spoke to your doctor and they wanted to help clarify the situation with your ultrasound. According to them, the issue with visibility during the ultrasound is likely due to the limited depth that the sound waves can penetrate. In the case of a surface ultrasound, the sound waves can only image about 3-4 inches under the skin. If there is a significant amount of fat under the skin, the sound waves may not be able to reach the organs, resulting in limited visibility.\n\nYour doctor assumes that a similar issue may have occurred with the internal ultrasound, where the fat around the organs may have blocked the sound waves. This would explain why the ultrasound was unable to provide a clear image. They believe that this is why an MRI was suggested as an alternative, as it uses a different technology that is not limited by the same depth restrictions.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions or concerns about this, and we'll be happy to help."}

Yesterday I noticed a slightly tender lump underneath the skin of the incision and went to the GP today - the GP thinks it is about 4cm in size and I have an ultrasound next month. Im just wondering what the most likely outcomes would be for the lump? It is only mildly tender but is starting to worry me! Thanks", "doctor_response": "Speaking as someone who frequently does ultrasound of such lumps - most likely outcome is that it's just a fluid collection and/or scar tissue in the incision site, that hopefully will diminish with time. One possibility after c-section though, is that a little bit of endometrial tissue from the uterus has been left subcutaneous. That's something you can help distinguish yourself - if this lump varies in size and achiness with your menstrual cycle. Cancer would be very, very low on my list of things to worry about here.", "response": "I spoke to your doctor and they wanted to address your concerns about the lump under your C-section incision. Based on their experience with ultrasounds for similar lumps, they believe the most likely explanation is that it's a fluid collection or scar tissue at the incision site, which should decrease in size over time.\n\nHowever, they did mention another possibility that can occur after a C-section: a small amount of endometrial tissue from the uterus might have been left under the skin. One way to help determine if this is the case is to pay attention to whether the lump changes in size and tenderness during your menstrual cycle.\n\nYour doctor also wanted to reassure you that cancer is extremely unlikely in this situation.

{"id": "xnr80p_20241101", "question": "5 yo healthy male. How much coughing is acceptable after dexamethasone? My 5 yo son has recurrent croup and were waiting for a scope date from the ENT. I had to administer 16mg of dex last night 8:30p and this morning hes still coughing every 10 minutes. It doesnt have the tight bark or stridor but I wasnt sure if we needed to go to ED for epi to knock the rest of the inflammation down or if residual coughing is standard. I ask because dex seems to be getting less effective as he ages and Id prefer to avoid a midnight run. Thanks!", "doctor_response": "Not really worried about the cough itself. People can cough with any upper respiratory for days to weeks. Steroids and epi are not really indicated for the cough itself, its the stridor and difficulty breathing that we treat. If he doesnt have stridor or difficulty breathing its unlikely to change much, though there can be transient symptomatic relief. That being said if you are uncomfortable with your sons current clinical picture then bring him in to be evaluated. Better to be safe, its not something you need to risk.", "response": "I spoke to your doctor, and they wanted to reassure you that the coughing your son is experiencing after taking dexamethasone is not necessarily a cause for concern. Coughing can be a normal part of any upper respiratory issue and can last for several days to weeks. The doctor is more concerned with symptoms like stridor and difficulty breathing, which are the primary reasons for using steroids and epinephrine. Since your son is not experiencing these symptoms, it's unlikely that further treatment would make a significant difference, although it may provide temporary relief. However, if you're uncomfortable with your son's current condition or have concerns, the doctor recommends bringing him in for an evaluation. They would rather err on the side of caution and ensure your son's safety."}
{"id": "4cecv6_20241101", "question": "HPA dysfunction & low dose hydrocortisone for anxiety/depression Why is hydrocortisone not used more often for treating anxiety/depression? Low cortisol is basically when the stress response is exhausted isn't it? I know things like PTSD are linked to low cortisol. How come cortisol isn't a direct treatment to take the strain off the body until it recovers? Also, I am referring to low dosages of HC (5-20 mg) not the huge prednisone doses that are given and have the psychosis sides. So basically minimizing suppression effects.", "doctor_response": "Because you're mixing up cause and effect. Anxiety and depression are not caused by low cortisol levels. Plus anxiety and depression don't cause adrenal dysfunction (addison's disease). Even low doses of (hydro)cortisone can have bad side effects, plus it doesn't really treat the anxiety/depression. Correlation =/= causation.", "response": "I spoke to your doctor and they wanted to clarify some points regarding the use of hydrocortisone for anxiety and depression. According to your doctor, the relationship between cortisol levels and anxiety/depression is more complex than a simple cause-and-effect. While it's true that some conditions, such as PTSD, have been linked to low cortisol levels, this doesn't necessarily mean that low cortisol is the direct cause of anxiety and depression.\n\nYour doctor also emphasized that anxiety and depression are not typically caused by adrenal dysfunction, such as Addison's disease. Regarding the use of hydrocortisone, your doctor noted that even at low doses (5-20 mg), it can have negative side effects and may not effectively treat anxiety and depression. They want to stress that just because there may be a correlation between cortisol levels and anxiety/depression, it doesn't mean that one causes the other. Your doctor would like to discuss this further with you to determine the best course of treatment for your specific situation."}

After I healed up from that I got another cough and ear ache a few days later so I took some cough medicine. Well this weekend goes by and I'm more tired than normal so I rest up but still have this cough. Took some more cough medicine and then last night I wake up with chest pains. Like someone is sitting on my chest and when I breath in a sharp pain over my left lung. The night goes on and I have trouble sleeping off and on and eventually get up and cough up some light yellow mucus. one small (and I mean small) spec of blood was in the first bit I coughed up but nothing else in the rest. Coughed up mucus for an hour and have been drinking water the last few hours before having to get ready for work. I am already feeling better with barley any chest pain and not coughing up mucus up often.

Any over the counter medication I should take?", "doctor_response": "Nothing OTC will make you recover any faster. You didn't mention a fever. As long as you don't have a fever, you're probably fine.

{"id": "xayz9i_20241101", "question": "Really struggling with UTI-like symptoms while traveling abroad, what can I do? I am 30F and am on vacation with my boyfriend in Italy (Im from America) . I suspected that I might be getting my period a few days ago and put in a tampon that I took out after a few hours (once I realized that I in fact was not getting my period). The next morning, I woke up with horrible vaginal burning and discomfort. I am prone to vaginal irritation and burning (usually only lasts a few hours at most), and I happened to have some AZO pills on hand that I had brought with me. I took a couple and they finally started working after a couple hours. Unsure whether I had a UTI or not, I went into an urgent care clinic and they prescribed me an antibiotic called Monurol (it was a powder). I took both doses across 2 days and I felt a very slight improvement, but I still have a good amount of discomfort. In order to even feel well enough to function, Ive just been taking AZO to mask the discomfort (and I know this isnt a good thing to do). I cant get back into an urgent care until Monday since they are closed for the weekend. I am planning to go back in and see what else I can get that might help, but Im concerned because they said that to run a urine culture test could take a few days. The thought of having to continue feeling discomfort for that long is really difficult. I feel like Im caught in this vicious cycle of having to take a bunch of meds to even be able to function at all, but I always feel like I need more after a few hours. Does anyone know if there is a more effective antibiotic in Italy for UTIs that I should be looking for? Im also really worried that Im gonna run out of AZO, and that I wont have any other alternatives to purchase here. Any help would be much appreciated!", "doctor_response": "Hi there! If you are having UTI symptoms, then Monurol should be enough. Its normal to still feel discomfort, it may take up to 1 week to go away completely.

Also, you shouldnt take AZO for more than 2 days. Hope youll feel better soon.", "response": "Hi there, \n\nI spoke to your doctor and they wanted to address your concerns about the UTI-like symptoms you're experiencing while traveling abroad.
