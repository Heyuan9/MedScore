# This script automates the process of testing the MedScore package installation.
# It performs the following steps:
# 1. Defines the environment name and the package URL.
# 2. Creates a new, isolated conda environment with Python 3.9.
# 3. Installs the MedScore package from the specified GitHub branch using pip.
# 4. Runs the package's help command to verify the installation.
# 5. Removes the temporary conda environment to clean up.
#
# The script will exit immediately if any command fails.

# --- Configuration ---
# Use a specific name for the temporary environment to avoid conflicts.
ENV_NAME="medscore_temp_env"
BRANCH="presenticized"
# The correct git URL format for pip to install from a specific branch.
GIT_URL="git+https://github.com/Heyuan9/MedScore.git@${BRANCH}"

# --- Cleanup function ---
cleanup() {

    echo ">>> Cleaning up: Removing the temporary environment '${ENV_NAME}'..."

# --- Script Execution ---
# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
